# Introduction 

This reports compares the ALSI (J200) and the SWIX (J400) top 40 Indexes. Both indexes operate consist of the 40 most investable companies in the ALSI universe, and both operate an free float market cap weighting methodlogy. The key distinction between the two indices is that the SWIX differs by using the STRATE
(South Africaâ€™s Central Securities Depository) share register to reduce constituent weights of foreign or inward-listed companies.  The SWIX indices are therefore intended to be an indication of the shares held locally. 

The constituents of the SWIX 40 will be selected using SWIX-adjusted market capitalisation, and therefore the constituents of the SWIX 40 may differ from those of the ALSI Top 40 index. Investors have raised concerns about the high level of concentration of individual securities within the indices. This raises a discussion of capping individual securities to allow investors greater exposure to the rest of the market. This report investigates the differences between the two indexes. 


# Overall Comparison between SWIX and ALSI Top 40

The two Top 40 indexes are largely similar with small differences. The figure below compares their historical performance, and it is clear to see how synchronous the two indexes are.

In order to investigate this a bit further, I present the following figure showing the historic performance of the indexes' allocation to large caps using the exact weights as used by the index. As to be expected from a top 40 index, the majority of allocation are to large caps. If one compares the above figure to the figure below, under close inspection,  one can see that the magnitude of the y-axis is large in the full version (above) relative to the large-cap version. Small caps, intuitively, do not feature in top 40 indexes. 

```{r}

I turn to the medium-caps in order to draw a more distinct comparison between the two top 40 indexes. An interesting pattern emerges here, in the previous two figures, the J200 outperforms the J400 in 2021 (cumulatively), but with the midcaps, the J400 outperforms the J200. This could either be because the J400 has greatest exposure to midcaps or has the same exposure, but includes better midcaps. 

```{r}

MC_R_xts <- T40 %>% select(-Short.Name, -Sector, -J400, -J200) %>% filter(Index_Name == "Mid_Caps") %>%
    tbl_xts(., cols_to_xts = Return, spread_by = Tickers)

# Volatility 

I present a simple calculation about volatility that each indix experiences in times where the USD/ZAR has high or low volatility. I measure the standard deviation of the USD/ZAR, classify periods within above the 80th percentile of standard deviation as high volatility, and below the 20th percentile as low volatility. The results are as follows. 


```{r}
library(kableExtra)
# Volatile USDZAR 
zar <- read_rds("data/usdzar.rds")

ZARSD <- zar %>% filter(date > ymd(20080102)) %>%
mutate(YearMonth = format(date,"%Y%B")) %>% group_by(YearMonth) %>% summarise(SD = sd(Price)*sqrt(52)) %>%
mutate(TopQtile = quantile(SD, 0.8), BotQtile = quantile(SD,0.2))

Hi_Vol <- ZARSD %>% filter(SD >TopQtile) %>% pull(YearMonth)
Low_Vol <- ZARSD %>% filter(SD < BotQtile) %>% pull (YearMonth)

## Who has better vol? 

overall_SD <- port_compare %>% mutate(YearMonth = format(date,"%Y%B")) %>% group_by(Index) %>%
summarise(Full_SD = sd(Return)*sqrt(252))

high_vol_SD <- port_compare %>% mutate(YearMonth = format(date,"%Y%B")) %>%
filter(YearMonth %in% Hi_Vol)%>% group_by(Index) %>%
summarise(Highvol_SD = sd(Return)*sqrt(252))
    
Low_vol_SD <- port_compare %>% mutate(YearMonth = format(date,"%Y%B")) %>%
filter(YearMonth %in% Low_Vol)%>% group_by(Index) %>%
summarise(Lowvol_SD = sd(Return)*sqrt(252))


vol_compare_demo <- left_join(overall_SD, high_vol_SD, by = "Index")

vol_compare <- left_join(vol_compare_demo, Low_vol_SD, by = "Index") %>%
mutate(high_SD_ratio = Highvol_SD/Full_SD, low_SD_Ratio = Lowvol_SD/Full_SD) %>% kable()
vol_compare


```

The calculation shows that the standard deviation (SD) of the J200 is slightly less than the J400 in the full sample period. Furthermore, the SD of the J200 is lower than that of the J400 in high and low volatility times. However, if one compares the ratios, high volatility SD divided by full SD for example, one sees that the J200 has a greater ratio than the J400 in high volatility times and a lower ratio in low volatility times. In a sense, this means SD can change faster but within a smaller bound. 

# Capping the Indexes 



# Conclusion

The two indexes are very similar, however it is known that the SWIX focuses more on holding securities that mimic local holdings as opposed to foreign holdings.
